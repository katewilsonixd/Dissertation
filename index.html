        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The reward of employees has been notably put into practise from as early as the mid 1800’s, with examples such as confectionary giants Cadbury’s chocolate providing their employees with housing and recreational opportunities to unwind outside of working hours. Rewarding employees for their work has become a valued and recognisable tool for employers to build sustainable businesses and keep up with growing competitors. As technology has evolved reward systems have naturally moved to become online platforms that most businesses adapt to. </p>
 <p>
The Covid19 pandemic has pushed the importance of employee reward, to support and improve engagement remotely, and boost economically uncertain times. Following the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the cost-of-living crisis, research surveying UK residents shows that “65% of employees say it’s important their future employer has a financial wellbeing policy in place”, with Senior Policy advisor Charles Cotton, urging employers to “adopt a financial wellbeing policy or improve their existing one”[1]. Reward and recognition systems have evidently become part of a necessity in modern day work. To address how rewards systems improve the engagement and productivity of employees I will explore the types of rewards which form reward systems, defining what both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards are and how they play a part in building a foundation for motivating and engaging employees globally. I will talk about the timeline in which these systems evolved most significantly, from the 1800s to the year 2022.
		  </p><p>
Technology has changed the way that employees work, with working from home becoming a significant part of day-to-day life globally. I will discuss the overall impact that digital reward systems have upon the employee’s engagement and productivity in the workplace, with the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. I will explore the opinion that they have become a necessity for modern day businesses to both engage their employees leading to an increase in retention, and influx of employees, whilst creating the most productive outcome for their business. Exploring the overall happiness of employees and its relationship to the success of the business. In the words of Dr Bob Nelson, “appreciate employees and they will reciprocate in a thousand ways”.[2]

        </p>

      <section id="whatAndWho" class="content">
        <h2>What and Who?</h2>
        <p>
          Employee reward systems are programmes which have been created by an employer to reward performance and motivate employees on a vast number of levels within their working environment. Reward systems are normally deemed to be a separate payment to standard salary; however, they could be of subsidiary payment to the company, for example in the form of a gym membership. Rewarding employees can be separated into two distinctive categories of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. By definition, “extrinsic rewards are tangible, covering pay, bonuses and benefits”, whilst comparatively, “Intrinsic rewards are the psychological benefits each employee gains from making a meaningful contribution through their work.”[3] </p> <p>
To break down extrinsic rewards further, providing employees with monetary rewards in the form of payment, is the first type of reward that comes to mind when we think about motivational incentive. This incentive is always drawn back to the fact that “people work to earn a living… strive to put food on their table as well as to pay the bills.”[4] There is however a subsidiary fact that people have more readily available job opportunities which they can compare on modern day job sites such as reed.com, or Totaljobs. Today people can look past working in a job to pay their bills, if they have the opportunity to find an alternative position which provides them with rewarding incentives beyond money.
		  </p> <p>
Providing an additional cash bonus to an employee largely depends on the company and is usually a result of achieving set goals or targets. From the words of world leading employee recognition expert Dr Bob Nelson, “managers need to recognize and reward achievements and progress toward goals…especially thanking them when they do good work”[5]. The statement suggests that a bonus reward could be deemed a necessity to motivate and satisfy an employee. Amongst the additional cash bonus, employers can offer a variety of bonus choices, including redeemable benefits such as gym memberships, company cars, healthcare. These benefits can also be separate entirely from a bonus, and often provided as an extra perk of the job, otherwise known as a “fringe benefit”[6]. 
		  </p> <p>
It is important to identify the success of extrinsic rewards alone on a person’s motivation and engagement. From a 2008 study performed by Maritz Research it was revealed that “Rewards that are strictly monetary are not as effective as non-cash-based items”, this was distilled down further by the facts that monetary rewards are less “personal”, as they remove “opportunity to develop and grow interpersonal relationships”[7]. This draws questioning to the point made previously that “thanking'' an employee for their work using a bonus payment, could in-fact be unsatisfactory in the long run.
This is where the use of Intrinsic rewards come into play. Intrinsic rewards are connected largely to an emotional feeling of achievement that a person gets when completing a task and can be placed under the umbrella of various types of recognition. A common type of recognition is providing positive feedback to employees from management or encouraging sharing feedback of praise amongst and in front of fellow colleagues. According to Dr Bob Nelson “affirmation from co-workers can change employees’ attitudes and give them a greater sense of contentment”[8].Through building a sense of contentment in employees, studies show that in-turn motivation spikes, and quality of work increases. This is because employees who are noticed amongst their colleagues and team, are more likely to be highly motivated and perform well. [9] </p> 
		  <p>
 
So, who are these reward systems designed for? There is not a singular type of person who only benefits from reward systems, but instead, individual reasons why different people would benefit from certain rewards within the system. This is important as employee reward systems are entirely human-centred and should cater to engaging an employee based on their own achievements, strengths, and goals. We can firstly understand that the use of reward systems is increasingly more common, while the contents of these systems can vary between organisations. Statistics show that “companies around the world are spending more than £36 billion on employee reward and recognition programmes”[10], this is largely due to a demand for more competitive working conditions. Platforms such as Indeed, and Glassdoor allow people all over the world to compare employers, and weigh up benefits, salaries and general public reviews, supporting the idea that there is a market for people who deserve more than simply payment from an employer to feel engaged within their working environment, and this is entirely individualised.
		  </p> <p>
According to a report in 2014 employees within the lower income bracket are an identified target market for a reward system, with an aim to facilitate ways to improve the quality of working life. The systems aim to “reduce employee stress, assist progression in work and boost income in ways other than through direct pay”[11]. This holds true today in 2022 with a magazine article from HR magazine stating that bonus schemes are most important amongst other incentives to boost retention, and drive engagement. With other incentives being flexible working, and further opportunity to learn and develop[12]. Collectively, these incentives are a bare-bone basis for modern-day employee reward and recognition application, which will be discussed further in section two.
		  </p> <p>
Reward systems today have become an expected part of everyday work and can be utilised to support people in moving forward within their role at any given company. Employees, as humans respond well to verbal appraisal, and so confirmation through social rewards, can support an employee in believing in their abilities and as a result being more productive at work. Reward systems can play a huge role in the overall attitude of the employee, with the feeling of achievement being created when they receive praise, they will naturally strive to achieve more.[13]

      <section id="onlineRewardPlatforms" class="content">
        <h2>Online Reward Platforms</h2>
        <p>
          According to an article by Clare Bettelley, rewarding employees for their role at work is a concept that has been put into practice long before digital employee platforms existed[14]. A great example of a new beginning for employees came in the mid 1800’s, as the management of Cadburys chocolate factory recognised the importance of employee welfare. Co-manager George Cadbury, led the factory under the belief that “he didn’t want anyone to work and live in a place where a rose couldn’t grow!”[15]. In 1860, Richard and George Cadbury practised this belief and created an upgraded factory named Bournville, known as “the factory in the garden”[16]. The garden surrounding the factory had space where men could “play cricket…a playground for girls; a kitchen where workers could heat up their meals” and many more benefits[17].
As a result of Cadbury’s attention to reward and recognise their employees, Cadbury’s organisation grew, and the factory expanded in 1893. Many employees were amazed to have experienced facilities that were “simply unknown” before joining the company.[18]
		  </p>
		  <p>
It was not just factories which experienced a change, as work moved into the 1990’s there was a slow but impactful change as offices transformed from “factory or production line” spaces, to a” more fluid design and layout”, in turn “the workplace became a far more social affair increasing collaboration between teams” in the 1950’s[19]. Interestingly the improvements to an employee’s work-life formed around them, before technology provided the ability to scale these motivational incentives at a larger scale. The transformation continued into the 1960’s which naturally evolved alongside office technology and the birth of computers which “marked the beginning of a new technological era changing the workplace forever”[20]. By the 1980’s computers became increasingly prominent in the workplace, as the world of business boomed, so did technology, and by the 1990’s “computers had made their mark and every major enterprise had them”[21]. According to SpaceIQ, leading experts in workplace management, there was a huge impact from advancing technology in the 2000’s, and the invention of cloud data provided employees the flexibility to work from home[22].
		  </p>
		  <p>
 
With remote working on the rise in the early 2000’s, there were new opportunities to build innovative reward systems online, maintaining employee’s engagement and productivity, whilst separated from the environment and physical office spaces which employees associated with their work-life. According to an article from employee benefits in 2014, the use of online platforms opens new avenues to reward and recognise employees, with the opportunity for employees to be part of twenty-four-hour reward and recognition within their workplace. The rise in technology was providing an accelerator, and new interactive rewards such as the ability to gather virtual money , gift cards, or opportunities to select days off work[23].
		  </p>
		  <p>
In 1999, a now long-standing example of employee centred reward and recognition was founded. Workhuman, previously known as Globoforce, became one of the first digital reward employee applications. The company has been described as “pioneering the workplace”[24], with the aim to recognise employees, connect teams and overall retain employees, with a human-centred focus[25].
		  </p>
		  <p>
The success and distinctive industry positioning for the company, can be proven through its twenty- two years plus of long-standing growth. Workhuman currently holds 6 million users around the world and supports thirty plus languages across their customer-base. Key features of Workhuman’s solution include social recognition, virtual rewards and monetary or redeemable rewards offered by the company[26].
		  </p>
		  <p>
According to an article from Talent management and HR, the key to engagement and successful outcome of the employee are a combination of engagement, rewards, acknowledgement and a positive work culture[27]. These criteria go hand in hand with the opportunities that an instantly accessible and twenty-four-hour platform can provide. In turn the opportunity to provide continuous reward and recognition allows companies to improve employee retention, resulting in decreased turnover and recruiting costs and increased productivity[28].
		  </p>
		  <p>
As awareness of the success of employee reward and recognition spread, more and more digital reward and recognition platforms were founded. In 2015 companies such as Nectar limited were founded. The company set out to “build a culture people won't want to leave”[29]. According to Nectar’s website, the application features include the ability to provide social recognition amongst teams, receive and choose rewards, award team members, challenge employees to achieve and meet milestones, and access a range of perks that the company has available to the employee[30]. Feedback from customers reflect the impact of the application upon the company and teams, one user discussed  how employees are noticeably “eager to work hard and do their best to get recognition over Nectar.”[31] Evidently there is a connection drawn between the assistance of Nectar and the productivity of the employee, as Nectar state that “94% of customers see an increase in employee engagement”, and 89% agreeing it “has helped maintain remote work culture”[32] The significance of this statistic is important today as the movement of remote working has only increased since the 2000’s, with fifty of the largest UK employers stating “they have no plans to return all staff to the office full-time in the near future” from a BBC news report in 2020[33].</p>
 <p>
Today digital reward applications and programs have become an everyday normality across a scale of industries. An example of this could be an employee position at costa coffee working part time, in comparison to a full-time employee at cyber-security company Rapid7. The costa coffee employee may not expect to have outstanding benefits; however, perks of the job will be more than often considered, and compared using the evolutionary benefits of reviews, and comparison sites. In comparison the employee at Rapid7, will most definitely have expected to see rewards including opportunity for healthcare, childcare, bonus opportunity, and other rewards. As Technology has become such a natural part of people’s lives, employees now expect to receive login details for some form of salary-based application on starting a job, and it is the companies who go beyond pay that stand out amongst the rest. An Article by Bonusly reward and recognition platform, touches on the fact that employees don’t just expect they “demand”, more than simply money from a company, but other incentives such as social recognition, culture and progression.[34]

      <section id="theImpactOfRewardSystems" class="content">
        <h2>The Impact of Reward Systems</h2>
        <p>
          The impact of employee reward systems can be narrowed down into three key areas, these include an impact upon retention rate, the Influx of employees to a company, and the overall wellbeing and happiness of an employee. In a podcast with Adam Kingl, a leader in the modern workforce, he discussed research which stated that the Gen Y have different views about how long they might stay with an employer, a survey carried out showed that 90% do not plan to stay more than 5 years. Kingl addresses the importance of development opportunities, growth, culture and work-life balance, a combination of monetary and non-monetary rewards which drive people to stay within a company for a longer period-of -time[35].
It can however be taken into consideration that as the tech industry has grown, employees within that industry are more likely to leave companies after a couple years. This does not necessarily mean that the company they are currently with is not offering them benefits, support, or growth opportunities, but simply that there is ‘more’ money to be offered or ‘better’ benefits at the competitive company. This is something that modern day employees are becoming aware of, and employers can both capitalise on, and take as an opportunity to improve their reward systems.
 </p><p>
A statistic from Apollo Technical in 2022 stated that “Over 91% of HR professionals believe that recognition and reward make employees more likely to stay”[36] This is evident in companies such as tech giants Adobe inc. According to a report from Comparably, a website for global reviews, Adobe has been ranked as No 1. for “happiest employees in 2021”[37]The review also states that Adobe’s retention rate of employees is within the top 5% of comparable companies, and “71% would not leave Adobe if they were offered a job for more money”[38]This is an impressive statistic is we consider the competitive nature of the tech industry which encourages frequent influx from company to company[39]. According to Gloria Chen the Chief People Officer at Adobe, she believes that employees are remaining in the company due to many contributing factors including the employer's attention to rewarding culture, flexible work schedules, and increase of its wellness reimbursement to six-hundred dollars per year. Statistics from reward gate 2022 across the UK, Australia and US, revealed that “40% of employees would leave a job due to lack of reward, recognition and wellbeing support.”[40] From this the conclusion can be made that the digital reward platforms have a huge impact on the engagement and productivity of the employee, leading to high retention rates.
 </p> <p>
Adam Kingl makes an interesting point that Gen Y would be more likely to use a service based on online reviews now, in comparison to the previous generation of people who would generally choose to take opinion first hand from a person they know. This is expressed in an article from screen and reveal, as “69% of job seekers will decline a job offer from an organisation with a bad reputation”.[41]
		  </p>
		  <p>
A great impact has been made on the influx of employees to companies based on the reward systems that they offer. Specifically post-pandemic, people are looking for flexible working, and bonus opportunities which will improve their quality of life, as previously mentioned, the current cost of living crisis has emphasised this. The pandemic has proven that in person social interactions are not necessary to work successfully as people adapt to working from home, reward expert Sven Skillrud states in an interview in 2021[42]. According to an article from PWC, people are more likely to leave a job to find flexibility elsewhere than work in the office full time, as hybrid working has become the preference due to the impact of the Pandemic. Employees are looking for benefits which will draw them in such as childcare, mental health resources and other perks, all delivered virtually[43]. From this it can be evaluated that digital rewards systems have now become a number one priority when looking for a job, as employees need to know they are both receiving bonus, opportunity, flexibility and growth within a company, whilst in combination with the demand for a hybrid work-life. As Alistair Woods of people analytics at PWC summarises, the heart of direction for companies today must have “a reward system that recognises their contribution, reflects a changing world and keeps them motivated.”[44]
		  </p><p>
There is evidence to support the link between the impact of reward systems and the overall happiness of an employee, which in-turn leads to productive and engaged employers. A statistic from Apollo Technical in 2021, stated that “Business productivity increases by 31% when employees are happy.”[45] One of top two reasons that employee stated to remain in their job was recognition and reward, with non- monetary rewards such as verbal praise being placed above cash bonus incentives.[41]
		  </p> <p>
Digital Reward and Recognition platform Bonusly runs on the belief that the use of reward systems “leads to happier employees”[46] Bonusly’s core application functionality includes building strong teams, through recognising and rewarding achievements anywhere, which in turn will boost the engagement of the employee. Customer research carried out on the impact of the reward system in 2021 showed that “89% of respondents said that Bonusly improved employee satisfaction.” It is with the increase in overall happiness and therefore satisfaction of the employee that a link can be made to the likelihood of better retention rates, at which point the online world of positive employee reviews will circle to increase new influxes of talent to the company. The ability to engage an employee has evolved from the capabilities of technology, as companies capitalise on the sharing of positive feedback, reward and incentive amongst teams in a quick and digestible way.
		  </p>
 

      </section>
      <section id="conclusion" class="content">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Reward systems have evolved dramatically since the 1800’s. With the definition of a reward system developing over time, we can see that the common principles of what employees need to be engaged with an employer are somewhat similar. Historically speaking, employees have always reacted to one thing, this is an overall appreciation from the employer for the contribution that the employee has made. This can evidentially be shown through considerations of an employee’s out of work hours, such as that in the Cadbury’s factory in the 1800’s. Employees played cricket in the field outside the factory and received physical perks such as utilities to use on their lunch breaks or housing to accommodate them.[47] This is comparable to the modern- day digital reward application which starts at the core of sharing positive feedback to the employee, providing opportunity to be appreciated through digital incentive of badges, or physical incentives such as cash bonus, memberships, or other recreational activities. </p>
		  <p>
There has been evidence to support the effect of the reward systems on employee recognition and engagement within a company. As Cadbury’s factory provided reward to their employees the company grew with an expansion of the factory in 1893[48]. Similarly, there was evidence that employee’s engagement and productivity within a company increased when using online reward platforms such as Bonusly with customers sharing success stories in research carried out by the company in 2021[49]. </p> <p>
The evolution of technology alongside the increased demand from reward systems due to the COVID19 Pandemic has made digital reward systems a top priority for employers. As employees now have the ability to work anywhere anytime, they expect a system which facilitates their human needs for appraisal and a push in the right direction which digital reward systems provide, as discussed in a podcast from Adam Kingl[50]. With the ability to compare employer to employer online it is now very easy for job seekers or employees to find something better, which offers them competitive benefits. Research statistics show that employees are more likely to be engaged in a company which rewards and recognises its employees[51]. </p> <p>
Digital Reward and Recognition applications have become vital in engaging an employee and producing higher levels of productivity, as Hybrid work becomes a part of day-to- day life in 2022. There is a demand for the world of technology to support employees emotionally, mentally and financially whilst working virtually. Engaged and productive employees today are largely a result of the online systems which build the bridge between company leaders and the employee. In the words of Dr Bob Nelson, “you get what you reward”[52], meaning that if an employer utilises rewards today, there will be a significant impact on the successful outcome of the employee and in turn the company.
